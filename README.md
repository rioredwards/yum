## Feedback

Feel free to reach out with any questions, feedback, or suggestions.

Yum currently supports syntax highlighting for the following languages:

- JAVASCRIPT
- TYPESCRIPT
- HTML
- CSS
- PYTHON
- REACT
- PHP
- RUBY
- SVELTE
- SQL
- MARKUP
- JSON
- GRAPHQL

If your language is not on this list, feel free to open an issue and I will do my best to add support for it. Alternatively, you can fork the [repository](https://github.com/rioredwards/yum) and add support yourself.

I have a built-in script for generating the theme (JSON) file based on some predefined colors. It's basically a work-around for JSON not supporting variables. I haven't had the time to make it user-friendly yet, but it's there if you want to try it out. The script is called replaceInFile.js.
